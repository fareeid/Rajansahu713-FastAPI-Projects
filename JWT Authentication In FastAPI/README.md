# JWT Authentication in FastAPI
This repository contains a project demonstrating how to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a FastAPI application. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Features
* User registration and login endpoints.
* JWT token generation upon successful login.
* Protected endpoints that require JWT authentication.
* Token verification and user retrieval from the token.
* Error handling for authentication-related issues.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* FastAPI
* PyJWT
* Uvicorn (for running the FastAPI app)
