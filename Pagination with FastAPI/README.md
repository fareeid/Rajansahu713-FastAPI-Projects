# Pagination with FastAPI
This repository contains examples and demonstrations of implementing pagination with FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Overview
Pagination is a common technique used in APIs to handle large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks or pages. This helps improve performance and usability by reducing the amount of data returned in a single request.

FastAPI provides convenient features for implementing pagination in your API endpoints, allowing you to efficiently handle large datasets while ensuring responsiveness and scalability.
